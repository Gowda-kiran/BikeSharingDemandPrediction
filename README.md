# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
> This project focuses on building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. The dataset used for this analysis is 
provided by the US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes, which aims to understand the key variables influencing bike demand and optimize its business strategy accordingly.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  
BoomBikes has faced revenue challenges due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and aims to prepare a business plan to accelerate revenue once the situation improves. The goal is to 
understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes and predict demand levels post-quarantine. The specific objectives are to identify significant variables predicting 
bike demand, evaluate their impact, and provide insights for business strategy.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 1.3.4
- NumPy - version 1.20.3
- Seaborn - version 0.11.2
- MatplotLib - version 3.4.3


## Conclusions
The multiple linear regression model developed in this project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing bike demand for BoomBikes. The results will assist in shaping a
 strategic approach to meet customer expectations and optimize business operations.



## Acknowledgements
- This assignment is from Upgrad IIIT B AI & ML Program  gives an idea about how real business problems are solved by MLR.
- In this assessment, apart from applying the techniques I have learnt in Linear regression, it has helped me to develop a basic understanding of Linear regression by practically 
implementing the concepts on a real-world dataset. The hands-on experience gained from data preparation, model building, and evaluation has reinforced my comprehension of the 
linear regression algorithm, enhancing my ability to analyze and interpret the relationships between independent and dependent variables in predictive modeling
